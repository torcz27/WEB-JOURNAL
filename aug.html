															Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines the real world and computer-generated content. The content can span multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.</p></dt>
															<dt><p><h4>How does augmented reality work?</h4></p></dt>
															<dd><p>Augmented Reality works by superimposing digital information onto real-world objects to create a 3D experience that allows users to interact with both the physical and digital worlds. But AR does not and cannot exist in a silo; its true value is in being part of a cloud-connected Industry 4.0 ecosystem that incorporates 
																
															<dt><p><h4>Here’s an overview of the augmented reality process:</h4></p></dt>
															<dd><p>1.	An AR-enabled device with a camera such as smart glasses, a tablet, or a smartphone parses a video feed to identify a physical object or the environment around the user, such as a piece of machinery or the layout of a warehouse. </p></dd>
															<dd><p>2.	A digital twin – a 3D digital replica of the object in the cloud – connects the real and virtual environments. It collects information from the physical object and digital.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>3.	The augmented reality device then downloads information about the object from the cloud. It superimposes digital information over the object using markers or trackers like GPS, accelerometers, orientation and barometric sensors, and more. This creates a part-real, part-digital 3D interface.  </p></dd>
															<dd><p>4.	Thanks to real-time data flowing from products, the user can interact with the object or environment by moving around and sending commands to the cloud through a touchscreen, by voice, or with gestures. </p></dd>
															<dt><p><h4>What is mixed reality, or augmented reality vs. virtual reality?</h4></p></dt>
															<dd><p>While the differences between augmented, virtual and mixed reality are subtle, each type of technology interacts differently with the real and virtual worlds.  
 
															</p></dd>
															<dd><p>•	Virtual Reality: Virtual reality, or VR, removes people from the real world and fully immerses them in a virtual world using a head-mounted display or headset. In that virtual world of imagery and sounds, users can move around in all directions, manipulate objects, and more. VR is often used in healthcare, architecture, and education.  </p></dd>
															<dd><p>•	Augmented Reality: AR enhances, or augments, the real world with digital information. While augmented reality apps work through mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, in manufacturing and industrial settings where it benefits the user to have their hands free, glasses or headsets are the best gateways to the AR experience.  </p></dd>
															<dd><p>•	Mixed Reality: MR blends imagination and reality so that users can both see and interact with the real world and the virtual environment simultaneously. Think of playing a virtual video game while drinking real coffee and offering an imaginary character some of your coffee in your game – you're mixing realities. </p></dd>
															<dt><p><h4>What is augmented reality used for in industry?</h4></p></dt>
															<dd><p>In industry, AR can be used for everything from asset identification to knowledge transfer in the field to training. By incorporating the physical with the virtual to augment the way people work, augmented reality gives workers more information and context about the product or machines they’re working on and the world around them.  </p></dd>
															<dt><p><h4>AR is commonly used in the following areas: </h4></p></dt>
															<dd><p>•	Design and product development: Imagine being able to prototype virtual objects that designers and potential users can walk around and examine from every angle? Thanks to augmented reality, digital twins, and the IoT, product designers can bring products to life, test them, and adjust them before anything physical is ever built.  </p></dd>
															<dd><p>•	Maintenance, operational control, and safety: With AR, workers can gain immediate information on any machine they’re interacting with. They can access the latest user manual or connect with an expert anywhere in the world to help them assess or repair an issue. This supports continuous production and non-disruptive performance.  </p></dd>
															<dd><p>•	Employee and operator training and learning: Augmented reality allows employees to get trained on any machine or equipment “on demand,” turning their immediate surroundings into an ongoing learning platform. It can also provide environments and scenarios that allow employees to hone their skills while increasing productivity and safety.  </p></dd>
															<dd><p>•	Quality control: Incorporating AR into quality control and assurance can help prevent defects during production, optimize the production process, and reduce time to market. For example, technicians wearing AR glasses can view a product and get information from IoT sensors embedded in the product components that generate information about each part and alert them to issues.  </p></dd>
															<dt><p><h4>Benefits of augmented reality in manufacturing</h4></p></dt>
															<dd><p>1.	Improved product development: Implementing AR during the design phase makes it possible for designers to respond to modern consumer demands for shorter product lifecycles and reduce costs associated with prototyping. </p></dd>
															<dd><p>2.	Simplified processes: Visualized workflows offering step-by-step instructions can support predictive troubleshooting while reducing mistakes that cause rework and speeding up complex assembly tasks for workers. </p></dd>
															<dd><p>3.	Streamlined warehouse management: AR can save time by managing inventory levels, guiding product picking, minimizing downtime by making it easier for technicians to diagnose and fix problems, and enhancing employee training. </p></dd>
															<dd><p>4.	Increased worker engagement: Because AR is a relatively new technology, the immersive quality of the 3D experience and the ability to learn by virtually doing is still novel for workers which boosts their engagement with the task at hand.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>5.	Reduced risk: AR doesn’t just replace the work or function of real equipment and people; it also creates a safe, experiential learning environment that allows workers to practice tasks virtually without risk. This improves worker safety, inspection, training, and workflow. </p></dd>
